Hi Everyone!

I'm Vaibhav. I'm a senior at the University of Michigan majoring in computer science and robotics. I have a focus on AI/ML applications. 

Past Work Experiences: 
1. Software Engineering Intern - ML at Amazon Lab 126
2. AI + Path Planning Student Researcher/Intern at Stryker
3. Software Engineering Intern at Kudan
4. Instructor Assistant - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

Things I do for fun: 
1. Play basketball
     - Try to go to the gym or the park at least twice a week
2. Watch sports
     - Baseball, basketball, and football (both college and nfl)
3. Go on walks
     - Usually at home with my dog (Yellow Lab)
     - In Michigan, I like going late at night because I always see deer by the pond near the School of Music or near Northwood
4. Reading - Prefer nonfiction books 
     - Some books I enjoyed include When Breath Becomes Air, American Kingpin, Bad Blood
5. Recently picked up guitar
      - Claiming recently even though its been like four years since it is a good excuse for not being as good as I would like


What I'm Working On Now: 
1. Model to determine player-team fit for NBA players using vector embeddings
   - Provide more information about each NBA players:
        - Details about NBA player measurements
        - Computer vision to track players to understand how they move on the court
   - Generate a higher quality model
2. Project for my AI for Compilers Class
   - Trying some cool Mixture of Experts Project (look at my repo for more details)
